# Weather-Dashboard

This app uses a server-side API [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

### Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I was challenged to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This was an education exercise to enhance my skills in retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of my own. From this project I have learned to access Third-party APIs  and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
